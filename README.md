# Modern CSS Reset

## Description

This CSS reset is designed to provide a clean and consistent foundation for your web projects. Inspired by contemporary best practices and the latest recommendations, it helps ensure your styles start from a predictable base, making development more straightforward and efficient.

## Features

- **Box Sizing Rules**: All elements and pseudo-elements use `border-box` to ensure padding and borders are included in the elementâ€™s total width and height.
- **Core Body Defaults**: A minimum height of 100vh and a line height of 1.5 for better readability and full-height layouts.
- **Balanced Text Wrapping for Headings**: Utilizes `text-wrap: balance` to improve the appearance of heading text.
- **Inherited Fonts for Inputs and Buttons**: Ensures that form elements inherit the font-family and font-size from their parent element for consistency.
- **Resizable Textareas**: Sets a minimum height for textareas to avoid them being too small by default.
- **Enhanced Scroll Margin for Anchored Elements**: Adds extra scroll margin to anchored elements to improve user experience.

## Usage

Simply include this CSS file at the beginning of your project to ensure a consistent and modern starting point for your styles:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/reset.css">
```
